# cga-druid
Conformal Geometric Algebra experiments in Rust. Uses:

 * Druid to get a window and receive input events
 * Piet to draw in 2D
 * Ganja.js's generated Rust code for the conformal 2D algebra

I want to make 2D UIs based around vector graphics instead of pixels. A simple drawing app seems an obvious project to undertake
